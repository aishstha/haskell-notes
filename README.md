#  Functional programming

Functional programming keeps 
 1. functions and data separate. 
 2. It avoids state change and mutable data, and 
 3. it treats functions as first-class citizens. 
 
 
 ## 1. functions and data separate.

 Object-oriented programming, as we see in this simple class representing a person, likes to group together its data with the functions in charge of operating on that data. For instance, we have this variable, age, and then we have a function in charge of incrementing the variable. In contrast, functional programming stores its data in simple constructs like arrays or hashes and makes separate functions that take the data as an argument and return some sort of transformed version of the data.
